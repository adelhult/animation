# Animation 🎥
Library for making, composing and playing basic animations, inspired by [reanimate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reanimate-1.1.6.0/docs/src/Reanimate.Animation.html).

Very much work in progress. Will clean-up the API and a bunch more of useful functions before releasing.
```bash
animation = { git = "git@github.com:adelhult/animation.git", ref = "main" }
```
